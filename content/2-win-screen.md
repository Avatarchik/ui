# `2.3.` _GUI_ - **Win screen popup**

The win screen is heavily integrated into the levels system. There's no wrapper function for ONLY opening the win screen. The win screen only appears when calling `PMWrapper.SetLevelCompleted`, as mentioned in the [`2.2.`&nbsp;Level&nbsp;system](/content/2-levels.md) page.

The win screen contains a _"Congratulations"_ text, a close button, and if there's a level after the current one it also has a _"Next level"_ button.

### Example
