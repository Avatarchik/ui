# `1.3.` _Setup_ - **Updating from 0.5 and above**

If you already have version `0.5` or above then this process will be very quick.

---

## Step 1 - Remove old version

In each update it is important to remove the old one so no files are left straying among your assets.

From version `0.5` the PythonMachine will keep its files in a sub folder, called `_Pythonmaskinen/`. Delete that entire folder.

## Step 2 - Download

If you haven't already, you should get your hands on the latest release of the **PythonMachine UI**. Download can be found at the [Releases tab (link)](https://github.com/HelloWorldSweden/PythonMaskinen-UI/releases).

## Step 3 - Import package

Importing a package into Unity is super simple. Personally, I just prefer drag'n'dropping the package file into the Unity window, but can also be done by going into the `Assets` tab, choosing `Import Package`, and then `Custom Package...`

After that you select the file `PyhtonMaskinen.UI.unitypackage` from your file system, and when Unity gives you the option to select what to import, you just press `Import` to import everything.

Now you may have to wait a minute while Unity does all the hard work of compiling the IDE, but once the loading bar has disappeared you're ready to go!

## Step 4 - Getting started

It's always recommended to visit the [`1.4.` Getting started](/content/1-getting-started.md) page at least once.

For the fact of you updating you've probably gotten used to the PythonMachine, but to keep yourself up to date with the new features check out the changelog at the [Releases tab (link)](https://github.com/HelloWorldSweden/PythonMaskinen-UI/releases).
