# `1.1.` _Setup_ - **Installing from scratch**

So you want to start a new project using the almighty PythonMachine?
Well step right in, the installation is very simplistic.

---

## Step 1 - Download

If you haven't already, you should get your hands on the latest release of the **PythonMachine UI**. Download can be found at the [Releases tab (link)](https://github.com/HelloWorldSweden/PythonMaskinen-UI/releases).

## Step 2 - Import package

Importing a package into Unity is super simple. Personally, I just prefer drag'n'dropping the package file into the Unity window, but can also be done by going into the `Assets` tab, choosing `Import Package`, and then `Custom Package...`

After that you select the file `PyhtonMaskinen.UI.unitypackage` from your file system, and when Unity gives you the option to select what to import, you just press `Import` to import everything.

Now you may have to wait a minute while Unity does all the hard work of compiling the IDE, but once the loading bar has disappeared you're ready to go!

## Step 3 - Getting started

Now that you have the package installed, you need to know how to start using it.
For that, it's recommended to visit the [`1.4.` Getting started](/content/1-getting-started.md) page.
