# `5.4.` _Miscellaneous_ - **Hax _(Skipping levels)_**

This tool is build solely for teachers in the case of a student maybe accidentally closing their game, only to find that they have to redo everything, and they just lose all motivation.

To compensate, the teacher can quickly unlock each level to the point to where the student previously was, so they can continue and may help them get back their motivation.

## The keyboard combo

To use this _"hax"_ you simply press the following key combination:

# `SHIFT + F4`

This will unlock the current level. So to skip to the third level you may have to use it twice.

> _The keyboard combination was specifically chosen so that no one really accidentally use it. Most refrain from using the function keys, especially the `F4` key since `ALT + F4` is a common shortcut to close the application._

## Disabling the _"hax"_

If you wish to disable this functionality _(for example for an official release)_, you may simply do that by disabling or removing the `Hax` component that is attached to the IDE prefab.
