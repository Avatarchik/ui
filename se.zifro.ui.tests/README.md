# Zifro Playground UI - Test Assemblies

These files are here as a workaround.

Assembly definitions (`.asmdef`) using "Test Assemblies" (NUnit, Unity Test Runner, etc.) does not compile when imported as a package. Therefore, until this is fixed by Unity, this workaround is here.

The `.dll` and `.pdb` files here are just taken from the `Library/ScriptAssemblies` folder. Nothing fancy.
